# MPMB XUA25AS "Arcane Subclasses"
This script adds the subclasses from the 2025 *Unearthed Arcana: Arcane Subclasses* article.

**This script is to be used in conjunction with the 5.24E scripts by ThePokésimmer. It will not work properly without those installed first. You can find those scripts here: https://github.com/thepokesimmer/2024-PHB/tree/main**

**Script Credit Note:**
This file has been compiled by MasterJedi2014, though the bones of the script are based on the code from MPMB and those who have contributed to the sheet's existing material in the "all_WotC_pub+UA" script. I am also using code within the script written by the users Shroo, ThePokésimmer, & TrackAtNite. The only things in this script that I can currently take credit for are:
- Alterations made to address changes made by the UA.

This script will allow users to more easily playtest the revised Arcane Subclasses content. Note that the current version only includes the Arcana Cleric subclass, with the other subclasses being added in later versions.

**Script Patch Notes:**
- **2025-03-01:**
  - Initial upload of script (V1) with Arcana Cleric.

**Known Bugs:**
- Will alter when one is found.
